# GraphQL Server Example

This is a sample GraphQL server repo

It goes slightly beyond [The Strawberry GraphQL Getting Started Guide](https://strawberry.rocks/docs), but skips some of the follow-up which I did not agree represented much benefit.

## Usage

There are three operations currently:

- get all books
- get specific book
- create a new book for the collection

## Running

`strawberry server app`

## Docs

Documentation can be found under the [/docs](/docs) section of the repo.
