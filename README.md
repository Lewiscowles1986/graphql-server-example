# GraphQL Server Example

This is a sample GraphQL server repo

It goes slightly beyond [The Apollo GraphQL Getting Started Guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/), but skips some of the follow-up which I did not agree represented much benefit.

## Usage

There are two operations currently:

- get all books
- create a new book for the collection

## Running

Commands have been added to `npm` `"scripts"` section. You can get a listing from `npm run` with no arguments.

### Compile and run

`npm run compile && node ./dist/index.js`

### Compile

`npm run compile`

### Run

After successfully building, you can use the following command to run using the NodeJS engine.

`node ./dist/index.js`

## Docs

Documentation can be found under the [/docs](/docs) section of the repo.
